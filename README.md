An opinionated wrapper for [roots/wp-config](https://github.com/roots/wp-config) enabling a more object-oriented config definition style for Bedrock projects. Used as the base of Tiny Pixel managed WordPress applications.

Not safer or better, just different. Currently `roots/wp-config` has way better coverage, in fact.
